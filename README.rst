omero-rdf
==================================

A plugin for exporting rdf from OMERO


Requirements
============

* OMERO 5.6.0 or newer
* Python 3.6 or newer


Installing from PyPI
====================

This section assumes that an OMERO.py is already installed.

Install the command-line tool using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

::

    $ pip install -U omero-rdf

Release process
---------------

This repository uses `bump2version <https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/>`_ to manage version numbers.
To tag a release run::

    $ bumpversion release

This will remove the ``.dev0`` suffix from the current version, commit, and tag the release.

To switch back to a development version run::

    $ bumpversion --no-tag [major|minor|patch]

specifying ``major``, ``minor`` or ``patch`` depending on whether the development branch will be a `major, minor or patch release <https://semver.org/>`_. This will also add the ``.dev0`` suffix.

Remember to ``git push`` all commits and tags.
